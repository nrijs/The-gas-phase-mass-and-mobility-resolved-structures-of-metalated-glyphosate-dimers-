# The-gas-phase-mass-and-mobility-resolved-structures-of-metalated-glyphosate-dimers-

This repository contains the optimised geometries (output and coordinate files) of [M(glyphosate)(glyphosate-H)]+ complexes

The output files either have a .log or .out extensions and the coordinate files have .xyz extensions.

Gas phase and solution phase optimised structures are in their respective folders.
